#Eventscripts Plugins Depot
Eventscripts rewrite project

The main idea.

If the game is multilanguage - messages is on the local language.

You may force displaying language by the cfg

If no such language - displaying in English

In the language file first is always English, then alphabetically

All languages are set in the language.ini file in the plugin's folder

All cfg files are situated in the ../cfg/plugins/%pluginname% folder

No configs or language strings in the plugin's file

All sounds situated in ../sounds/%pluginname%/%lang%_%package/

Sounds configuration file is ../cfg/plugins/%pluginname%_sounds.cfg

Sounds mp3 has NO ID3 tags at all

Thumbnails are situated in thumbnail.png
